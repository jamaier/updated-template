## Description
Working with an application created in Intro to Programming at Epicodus Coding School to refactor the application to include practicing with Jest. This project focuses on:

-Use of npm to manage packages, webpack to bundle code, and ESLint to lint code. If you are installing and configuring these dependencies from scratch, make sure to create your .gitignore first!
-Complete unit tests for all business logic using TDD and Jest. Aim for 100% test coverage.
-Complete separation of logic (UI logic in one file, business logic in another). You may even need to refactor some of your logic to make it more testable! If you aren't able to test UI logic, consider ways that logic could be refactored and moved into your business logic file.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone the repo down to your desktop and 
* Open up a new repo for the template.
* Change the project name in the package.json and in all associated .html and .js files
* Install all packages with $ npm install.
* Build the project using webpack with $ npm run build
* Start a development server with $ npm run start
* Lint JS files in the src folder with $ npm run lint
* Run tests with Jest using $ npm run test

## Known Bugs

* _Any known issues_
